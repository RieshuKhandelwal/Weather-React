# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Weather App

This is a simple and intuitive Weather application built with React.js and styled with Material UI.

## Features

- Search for a city to get its current weather information.
- Displays the city name, temperature, humidity, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and a brief description of the weather.
- The background image of the weather card changes based on the weather conditions (Rainy, Summer, Winter).
- Error handling for non-existent city searches.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

### Searching for a City's Weather

Enter the city name in the input field and click on the 'Search' button. If the city exists, the current weather information will be displayed. If the city does not exist, an error message will be displayed.
